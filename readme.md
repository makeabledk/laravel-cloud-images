This package provides a convenient to manage Google App Engine images through Laravel.

It assumes you already have a configured App Engine imageserver and GCS Bucket.

## Installation

You can install this package via composer:

``` bash
composer require makeabledk/laravel-cloud-images
```

On Laravel versions < 5.5, you must include the service provider and (optionally) register the facade in you `config/app.php`:

```php
'providers' => [
...
    \Makeable\CloudImages\CloudImagesServiceProvider::class,
]
``` 

```php
'aliases' => [
...
    'CloudImage' => \Makeable\CloudImages\CloudImageFacade::class,
]
```

Add a new `gcs` disk to your `filesystems.php` config

```php
'gcs' => [
    'driver' => 'gcs',
    'key_file' => env('GOOGLE_CLOUD_KEY_FILE', '/path/to/service-account.json'), 
    'bucket' => env('GOOGLE_CLOUD_STORAGE_BUCKET', 'your-bucket'),
],
```

See [https://github.com/Superbalist/laravel-google-cloud-storage](https://github.com/Superbalist/laravel-google-cloud-storage) for more details about configuring `filesystems.php`.

## Basic usage

### Upload an image

Easily upload a `\Illuminate\Http\File` or `\Illuminate\Http\UploadedFile` to your GCS bucket and create an image-url for it.

```php
$file = request()->file('image'); // assuming you uploaded a file through a form
$uploaded = \CloudImage::upload($file); // filename will be a hash of the uploaded file
$uploadedToPath = \CloudImage::upload($file, 'path/filename.jpg'); // optionally specify path and filename yourself
        
echo $uploaded->url; // imageserver url, eg: http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/...
echo $uploaded->path; // path in bucket
```

### Delete an image

Using the `delete` method will both delete the bucket file and destroy serving-image URL.

```php
\CloudImage::delete('path/filename.jpg');
```

Note that image-serving URL's can take up to 24 hours to clear from cache

### The good stuff: Generating images on the fly

Now that our image is served by Google, we can manipulate it on the fly. 

All you have to do to start manipulating images, is an instance of `ImageFactory`:

```php
$image = \CloudImage::upload($file)->make();
// or ...
$image = new \Makeable\CloudImages\ImageFactory($url); 
```

#### Contain to max dimension

```php
$image->maxDimension(800)->getUrl();
```

#### Crop to dimensions

```php
$image->crop(800, 500)->getUrl(); // Crop from top
$image->cropCenter(800, 500)->getUrl(); // Crop from center
```

#### Stretch to dimensions

```php
$image->scale(800, 500)->getUrl(); 
```

#### Custom parameters (advanced)

If the functionality you need is not provided by the package, you can specify your own google-compatible parameters:

```php
$image->original()->param('fv')->getUrl(); // This image will be flipped vertically
```

While the [official Google Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java/images/#using_if_lang_is_java_getservingurl_endif_if_lang_is_python_get_serving_url_endif) is poor to say the least, checkout this [Stackoverflow diskussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25148567/list-of-all-the-app-engine-images-service-get-serving-url-uri-options) and try out the possibilities for yourself!

## Extended usage (recommended)

While uploading and serving images is fine, you will likely need to store the references in your database and attach them to some existing models.

You will need to save both the URL as well as the bucket-path in case you ever want to delete them.

This package provides an easy and opinionated way of doing that.

### Extended installation

#### 1. Install `rutorika/sortable` package which is used to track sort-order 

```bash
composer require rutorika/sortable
```

#### 2. Install `intervention/image` to read and store exif-data on your images (optional)

```bash
composer require intervention/image 
```

#### 3. Run migrations 
```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### Uploading images

```php
$image = \Makeable\CloudImages\Image::upload($file); // a persisted eloquent model 

echo $image->path; // bucket path
echo $image->url; // image-serving url
echo $image->meta; // exif data 
```

### Model attachment with multiple images

First, use the `HasImages` trait on your parent model.

```php
class Product extends Eloquent
{
    use Makeable\CloudImages\HasImages;
}
```

Now you have an `images()` belongs-to-many relationship you can utilize as you normally would:

```php
Product::first()->images()->attach(Image::first());
```

#### Ordering attached images

Images will be kept in the order you attach them. However, you are free to reorder them afterwards.

```php
$product = Product::first();
$images = $product->images; // In this example we assume an collection of a few images

$product->images()->moveBefore($images->get(2), $images->first());
```

Checkout the *Sortable many to many* section of the [rutorika/sortable](https://github.com/boxfrommars/rutorika-sortable) package.

### Model attachment with a single image

If your model is expected to have just one image, you may use the convenient `image()` helper provided by the `HasImages` trait.

```php
$image = Product::first()->image(); // Always returns an Image instance - even if none uploaded
```

On the `Image` instance you may use the `make()` method to generate the size you need.

```php
$url =  $image->make()->cropCenter(500, 400)->getUrl(); // returns NULL if no image attached
```

#### Example model structure

```php
class Product extends Eloquent
{
    use \Makeable\CloudImages\HasImages;
    
    public function getImageSquareAttribute()
    {
        return $this->image()->make()->cropCenter(500, 400)->getUrl();
    }

    public function getImageWideAttribute()
    {
        return $this->image()->make()->cropCenter(1200, 400)->getUrl();
    }
}
```

Now you can access and append them as needed through your model

```php
echo Product::first()->image_square;
echo Product::first()->append('image_square', 'image_wide')->toArray(); // for array-casting
```

### Cleaning up old images

#### Deleting an image

When deleting an `Image` instance, the `CloudImage::delete()` method is automatically fired to delete the actual bucket file.

#### Deleting images with no attachment

Over time your `images` table may get bloated with images that no longer has model-attachments to them.

Use the `cloud-images:cleanup` command to delete images (along with the actual bucket files) that are no longer used.

```bash
php artisan cloud-images:cleanup
```
